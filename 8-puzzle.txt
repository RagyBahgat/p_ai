The project is about how we arrange a puzzle.

We use the copy library to make a copy of the matrix that we use in the puzzle so we can do some tests on it
to find the minimum moves we can do in the puzzle to solve it.

We used made some methods to help us do the project:
1- print_puzzle : we use it to print the puzzle.
2- check        : it checks how many numbers are not in thier places.
3- mann         : it implements the Manhattan method.
4- find_zero    : it helps us to find the place of the '0' (which is the blank space in the puzzle).
5- nodes        : it finds the possible numbers that can move to this palace.
6- move_node    : moves the number from a place to another.
7- min_moves    : to get the best number to move which will help in solvong the puzzle in minimum moves.
8- arrange      : the method which solve the puzzle in the least number of movements.
